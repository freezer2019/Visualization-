# COVID Trends Dashboard 

## COVID Trends Dashboard - Published here: https://covid-trends-us.herokuapp.com/index.html

Created and designed a dashboard using visualizations from the repository: COVID Trends: https://github.com/LisaHarrison08/COVID-Trends

Created individual pages and a means by which to navigate between them. The pages contain visualizations relating to the impact of COVID in the United States. Users can filter by state or date to review significant changes over time due to the pandemic. The home page includes a comparison of plots generated from data pertaining to small business revenue, COVID cases and deaths as well as Google Mobility data.
